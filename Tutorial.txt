*)"Starting parallel pool..." should appear at the bottom (Command Window)
5)  Wait until script is finished (time demand depends on the number of c3d files evaluated and your computer specs)
*)"Finished everything in..." should appear at the bottom (Command Window) 

6)  In the folder you have selected at step 4) you will find a new folder named "Classifier_..."
7)  In Classifier_.../XLSX you will have the EMG classifications on Sheet1 of the .xlsx file
